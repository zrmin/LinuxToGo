### Install LinuxToGo from zero to configure working environment
###### Origin
When I was a freshman, I became interested in Linux. At that time,
I followed the tutorial on the Internet to install the dual system, 
but then I found that every time I started the computer, I had to 
choose to open the Windows system, and sometimes I would do other 
things when I started the computer, which led me to always enter 
the Ubuntu Linux. At that time, I was still heavily dependent on
Windows. After all, I was a freshman. So later I removed Ubuntu Linux
from the dual system and started using a virtual machine to install
Linux. Then I stopped using virtual machines and just used the Windows
operating system.

In the first semester of my junior year, I began to systematically
learn the knowledge of Linux operation, such as commonly used file
management commands, vim, shell, git, etc. At that time, I started
to buy a cloud server and developed some Django based websites on
the cloud server.

And I see that teacher Jiang Yanyan of NTU always use his own U disk
to explain the operating system in the class, start his Ubuntu operating
system from the U disk, and use PPT and write code in it to teach students.
I think it is very cool, so I will also get one.
